###
# Problem 1 - Root composer.json requires joy/voyager-export ^1.2 -> satisfiable by joy/voyager-export[v1.2.1, ..., v1.2.17]. - joy/voyager-export[v1.2.1, ..., v1.2.17] require illuminate/support ^7|^8 -> found illuminate/support[v7.0.0, ..., 7.x-dev, v8.0.0, ..., 8.x-dev] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
